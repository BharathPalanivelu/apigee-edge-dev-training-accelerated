Feature: Payment Feature
	As an API user
	I want the CORS headers to be returned on an OPTIONS request
	so that my subsequent request from the web browser succeeds.

	Scenario: Allow OPTIONS request for /get
		When I request OPTIONS for /get
		Then response code should be 200
		And response header access-control-allow-headers should be origin, x-requested-with, accept, authorization, firebase-token, content-type
		And response header access-control-allow-methods should be GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
		And response header access-control-allow-origin should be \*
		And response header access-control-max-age should be 3628800
